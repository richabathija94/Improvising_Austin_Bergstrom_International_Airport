# Improvising_Austin_Bergstrom_International_Airport-SenseCorp-Hackathon-Winner-

### This project was created as a part of a Hackathon Challenge.
#### Total Team Members : 4
#### Time Alloted : 6 hours 
#### Overall place : 1st, Winner
This is one of my favourite projects as we created a very viable and holistic solution in just 6 hours.

## Use Case: ##
Austin Bergstrom International Airport is planning to extended with 12 new terminals. As consultants how would you come up with and solve various problems associated with this new plan.
## Figuring out the problems associated: 
1. The first 45 mins were spent figuring out what probems would erupt as a result of the massive extension of the airport        terminals.
2. Due to so many new terminals being built there would occur traffic congestion would be one of the biggest problems. 
3. Customer experience quality will get compromised 
4. How to improve the customer experience inside and outside the airport?
## Solution:
We divided our solution into three parts :
1. Inside Airport Experience:
   1. As Austin Bergstrom is an international airport, it should cater to people from all around the world
   2. Every person has a different threshold to tolerate temperature depending on the place where he/she is from.
   3. So we created a customised waiting lounge which would cater to individual body temperatures and lighting
2. Outside Airport Experience:
   1. People from outside the country always have trouble finding the right mode of transport after they land here.
   2. Created a single point of contact app which includes all local and online means of transport.
   3. It also has a recommendation system which would recommend the right mode of transport to the user based on traffic             during the time of the year 
3. Financial Statistics and profit margins
## Tools Used:
Twitter API - to scrape tweets to gain insights on real time public perception about the airport

React Native - to build the app
